## New additions and fixes!
### First of all, here is everything added in the latest update:
- This fancy new changelog announcement!
- You can now simply write the name of the tank in the menu when you're trying to pick it! Instead of writing out the ID
- New commands such as */leaderboard, /serverleaderboard, and /globalleaderboard*!. **Check them out!**
- And lastly, when a tank spawns in the chat. It is blocked from spawning for 5 minutes. So it no longer spams the chat.
- All users seen by the bot are now being cached.
### Bug fixes and other stuff:
- A bug where the page select reactions would stay when you looked at the info of a tank has been fixed.
- A bug where the bot would crash if you opened the info window due to complicated time out reasons has been fixed.
- Some minor spelling errors have been fixed.
